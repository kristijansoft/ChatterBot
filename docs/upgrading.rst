===========================
Upgrading to Newer Releases
===========================

Like any software, changes will be made to ChatterBot over time.
Most of these changes are improvements. Frequently, you don't have
to change anything in your code to benefit from a new release.

Occasionally there are changes that will require modifications in
your code or there will be changes that make it possible for you
to improve your code by taking advantage of new features.



Use the pip command to upgrade your existing ChatterBot
installation by providing the --upgrade parameter:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install chatterbot --upgrade

Also see :ref:`Versioning` for information about ChatterBot's versioning policy.
